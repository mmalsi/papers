#Introduction
Haywood et al (1999) made some great measurementsof BBOA over the Sahara.
We add to these measurements, with chemical composition data, using an aerosol massspectrometer (Allen et al 2000).

#Simulations
John has made some simulations of particle formation using his box model.
It reporduces the growth in size distribution observed and suggests coagulation ...
